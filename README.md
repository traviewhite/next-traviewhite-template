# next-traviewhite-template

An opinionated boilerplate to kickstart projects using Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this template:

```bash
npx creat-next-app <your-app-name> -e https://github.com/traviewhite/next-traviewhite-template
# or
yarn creat-next-app <your-app-name> -e https://github.com/traviewhite/next-traviewhite-template
```

Once the project and dependencies are installed, navigate to your directory and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your project!

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
